My collection of useful scripts

## Dot files

The main focus of this repository is on the config files.

* Shell: Bash -> [.bash_profile](.bash_profile) and [.bashrc](.bashrc)

* Editor: Emacs -> [.emacs](.emacs)

* IDE: Vscode -> [settings.json](settings.json)

* Version Control: Git -> [.gitconfig](.gitconfig)

* Remote login: ssh -> [ssh/rc](ssh_rc)

## Setup file

I've made a rather naive bash script to setup my development environment. It is something I played around with when I got a new laptop and I've roughly kept it up to date. It is currently built on the assumption that your using a mac but as I try out linux distributions I will edit the script to work for each distribution.
